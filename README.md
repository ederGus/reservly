# Reservly ‚Äî Reservation System (MVP)

Microservices-based reservation system built with **.NET 8, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Redis, Docker, and Kubernetes**.  
It allows organizers to publish events and attendees to reserve seats with an expiration window, pay online (Stripe) or in cash, and confirm with a **QR code** at check-in.

## üöÄ Features (MVP)
- Event publishing with capacity & sessions
- Reservation with hold window (anti-overbooking)
- Payment via Stripe (online) or cash
- Confirmation with email + QR code
- Check-in validation via QR token
- Microservices architecture + CQRS

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- .NET 8 (minimal APIs, MediatR, CQRS)
- MongoDB (aggregations, indexes)
- RabbitMQ (async messaging)
- Redis (reservation TTL)
- Docker Compose (local dev)
- Kubernetes (future deployment)
- Observability: Serilog + OpenTelemetry + Prometheus
